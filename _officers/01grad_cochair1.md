I am a first year masters student at CICS UMass. I like working on projects in Machine Learning and Deep learning. As a co-chair, I want to highlight the groundbreaking work that several women in computing have done and continue to do. 

Besides nerding away, I like music, I read books (strictly fiction) and learn new languages. When I get some more time, I like to hike, travel and explore new cities. Feel free to contact me at manpreetkaur@cs.umass.edu to talk in broken french and spanish or fluent hindi and english.
