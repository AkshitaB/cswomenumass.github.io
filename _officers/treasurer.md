I am a PhD candidate and former CS Women co-chair whose research concentrates on understanding the abstractions necessary to build programming languages and tools for data scientists. My undergraduate degree is in English Literature, from Wellesley College. For a longer bio, check out [my webpage](http://etosch.github.io/bio.html).

As co-chair, I initiated several new CS Women initiatives, including the Technical Workshop Series. As Treasurer, I will seek out funding for activities that align with the goals of CS Women and expand the involvement of members in our mission to create a more diverse student body.

I have broad interests and am very happy to discuss collaborations; if you're interested in discussing research, grad school, or really anything, please send me a [calendar invite](http://etosch.github.io/calendar.html) (I sometimes get very behind on email!).
