I am a second year Master student interested in Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and Data Mining. I work as a Graduate Research Assistant in the IESL lab. Previously, I earned a B.E degree in Computer Science from PES University, Bangalore, India.
In my free time I enjoy backpacking, hiking and cooking :D
