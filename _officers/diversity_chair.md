I am a first year graduate student at CICS. My research interests lie in Artificial Intelligence for Education and I am being advised by Prof Beverly Woolf at the CKC lab. I believe that a true success of a community is in its power of embracing diversity. As a diveristy chair, I aim at leveraging various platforms to raise awareness of diveristy in all its forms.

I worked at Cisco for 4 years before switching gears back to grad school. Trekking in the Himalayan peaks and western ghat of India had been my favorite pastime until recently it was replaced by Mt Sugarloaf in my backyard.
