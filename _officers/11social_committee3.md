I am a second year MS Student. I work on a project to track locations
and occupancy using anonymized data from the WiFi infrastructure in the
CICS building. I work with Prashant Shenoy & Emmanuel Cecchet on this
project.

What we do as the social committee is important to me because I believe
bringing people together in non-academic settings encourages friendships
and support systems that go beyond the lab.
