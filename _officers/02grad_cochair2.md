I am a fourth-year PhD student advised by [James Allan](http://cics.umass.edu/~allan) in the [Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval](http://ciir.cs.umass.edu). My [current research](http://cs.umass.edu/~jfoley) focuses on making search an effective and efficient tool for textual analysis and data science.

Before beginning as a co-chair in Spring 2016, I helped to organize the technical workshop series. I am also the current instructor for CS197U, an introductory unix course for undergraduate majors.

I received my Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering from UMass Lowell in 2012. When I'm not here, I'm off playing saxophones of all shapes and sizes as part of the Time Machine and Silvertones dance-bands at the premiere Senior Centers of the greater Lowell area.
