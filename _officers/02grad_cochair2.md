I am a first-year MS student, mainly interested in Distributed Systems, Cloud Computing and Computer Networks. Previously, I earned a B.Tech in Computer Science from National Institute of Technology, Warangal, India. 

As co-chair I help students receive travel grants, conduct technical workshops and talks. I am excited to further develop the success and reputation of CS Women. In my free time I enjoy hiking and practicing yoga :)

Feel free to contact me at nmundra@cs.umass.edu.
