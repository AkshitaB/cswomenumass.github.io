I am a fourth-year PhD student advised by [James Allan](http://cics.umass.edu/~allan) in the [Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval](http://ciir.cs.umass.edu). My [current research](http://cs.umass.edu/~jfoley) focuses on making search an effective and efficient tool for textual analysis and data science.

Before beginning as a co-chair in Spring 2016, I helped to organize the technical workshop series. I am also the current instructor for CS197U, an introductory unix course for undergraduate majors.
