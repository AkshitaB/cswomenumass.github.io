"You don't take a photograph, you make it.”

I’m first year graduate student generally interested in Machine learning, NLP and Computer Vision. I graduate in B tech Computer Science from Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology Allahabad in 2013, and worked for 3 years as Software Developer with Citrix Systems Inc at Bangalore India. 

In my spare time I enjoy cooking, hiking, traveling and photography.
