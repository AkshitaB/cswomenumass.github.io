Iâ€™m second year graduate student generally interested in Machine learning, Deep Learning and Computer Vision. Previously, earned the bachelor's degree in computer science from Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology Allahabad and worked as Software Developer with Citrix for couple of years.

As a MS chair, I represent the organization at public events, organize monthly lunches, help students get travel grants etc. I look forward to serve women graduate students, provide programs and services for our female-identified students.

I enjoy hiking, reading and bit of cooking!!
