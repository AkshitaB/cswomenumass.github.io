I am a fourth-year PhD student advised by Andrew McCallum. In my first year I briefly worked with Hava Siegelmann. I'm interested in developing new machine learning techniques to facilitate fast and accurate natural language processing of text. Previously, I earned a B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Maine with a minor in math, where I authored my most-cited work, a [tutorial](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~strubell/doc/quantum_tutorial.pdf) for undergraduates on quantum algorithms. My programming language of choice is Scala and my Linux distribution of choice is Gentoo. For more info check out my [personal website](http://cics.umass.edu/~strubell).

As co-chair I helped organize the Technical Workshop Series and am excited to further develop the success and reputation of CS Women. I have also served the department as a GEO steward and Graduate Student Senate representative, and plan to run for Grad Rep if I ever complete my synthesis project :)

In my free time I enjoy backpacking and nurturing various pet projects outside my research, including fermentation (saurkraut, kombucha, kimchi, cider) and [Plant Jones](https://github.com/patverga/plant_jones).
