I am a PhD candidate and former CS Women co-chair and Treasurer whose research concentrates on understanding the abstractions necessary to build programming languages and tools for data scientists. My undergraduate degree is in English Literature, from Wellesley College. For a longer bio, check out [my webpage](http://etosch.github.io/bio.html).

As co-chair and then treasurer, I initiated several new CS Women initiatives and sources of funding, including the Technical Workshop Series. As co-chair, I worked with [Emma Strubell](http://cs.umass.edu/~strubell) to revamp the CS Women website into what it is today. I am now a [CICS Grad Rep](http://cs.umass.edu/~gradrep) and have been spearheading new initiatives for our graduate student body. I also maintain the [Grad Reps Website](http://cs.umass.edu/~gradrep).

I have broad interests and am very happy to discuss collaborations; if you're interested in discussing research, grad school, or really anything, please send me a [calendar invite](http://etosch.github.io/calendar.html) (I sometimes get very behind on email!).
