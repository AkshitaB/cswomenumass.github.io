I am a second year PhD student working with Arjun Guha in the PLASMA lab. I graduated with a BS in
Computer Science from George Wasington University in 2015. My research interests include
programming languages, formal verification, and security. We are currently working on a platform
for dynamically splitting web applications into client-side code and server-side code.
