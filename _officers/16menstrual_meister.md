I am a third year grad student generally interested in 
AI, Computer Vision, and Machine Learning, and intersections of computer science and
other sciences. I graduated with a BA in Astronomy and Computer Science 
from Smith College in 2013, and worked for a year as a Data Process Developer 
at Gemini Observatory (Hilo, HI). I will be leaving the program with my Masters
in the spring of 2017. Formerly known as Message Meister (coffee and tea reminder emails), 
I regain my meister title in this role of keeping womens bathrooms stocked with 
emergency menstrual supplies.
