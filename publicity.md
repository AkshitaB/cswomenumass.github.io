UMass CS Women members are active throughout the UMass community. We work with the [College of Information and Computer Science](https://www.cs.umass.edu/) to attract and retain female students and coordinate our publicity through CICS. Our [Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/CSWomenUMass) features the accomplishment of our members under the `#goodnews` hashtag. For more information, contact womenchairs@cs.umass.edu.
