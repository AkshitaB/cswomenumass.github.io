Two graduate and two undergraduate Co-chairs provide executive leadership and are the primary points of contact for the CS Women membership. 

# Responsibilities
The responsibilities of the Co-chairs include but are not limited to:

* __Organizing the monthly lunches__. The scheduling, format, content, and duration of the monthly lunches is determined primarily by the graduate Co-chairs, with input from the undergraduate Co-chairs when appropriate.

* __Representing the organization at public events, upon request__. Co-chairs may be asked to speak on behalf of the CS Women organization, or as representatives of women's interests in the CICS. Co-chairs should split responsibilities between graduate and undergraduate Co-chairs, as appropriate.

* __Connecting the general membership with the resources they need__. Members of the CS Women general membership or outside the community may seek academic, personal, or professional assistance from the Co-chairs. Co-chairs should connect members with the appropriate resources, with input from the faculty liaison when in doubt. Forms of assistance include, but are not limited to:

  - Past Co-chairs have received tutoring requests from UMass undergraduates, 5-college students, and individuals who are not members of the local academic community. Co-chairs are under no obligation to tutor students; however, they may do so if they choose.
  - Conflicts with a student's advisor. The Co-chairs should connect the student with the current Graduate Employee Organization (GEO) stewards and/or the Graduate Program Director (GPD).
  - Co-chairs may be asked to advise or advocate on behalf of women's issues in CICS. Co-chairs should consult with the elected [Faculty Representative](#faculty_rep) and the appointed [Faculty Liaison](#faculty_liaison).
  - Title IX questions and violations. Students who have concerns that may fall under the purview of Title IX (gender discrimination in academic environments, including sexual harassment) may reach out to Co-chairs. Co-chairs should redirect students to the [Title IX coordinator](http://www.umass.edu/titleix/title-ix-team#coordinator) when appropriate.
  - Students may reach out to graduate Co-chairs when in need of emotional support or psychological services. As Co-chairs are not required to undergo any training for counseling, _they must encourage the student to talk to a professional_. Co-chairs should use their best judgment when determining whom to talk to for assistance.
* __Selecting new Co-chairs and reviewing applications for other positions__. New Co-chairs are recruited and appointed by existing Co-chairs. Other positions, such as Social Media Chair, Scribe, and Social Chair are by application.

* __Graduate Co-chairs should take on the responsibilities of the non-essential positions when those positions are not filled.__ These responsibilities may include web-master, social chair, social media/PR, etc.

# Selection
Interested parties should submit by email their intent to `womenchairs@cs.umass.edu`. The current Graduate Co-chairs will select from that pool. Preference will be given to graduate students who have assistantships at UMass over the summer months. Graduate Co-chairs may only serve one term.

# Term Length
Graduate Co-chairs each serve one term corresponding to one calendar year. Terms begin January 15 and June 15. Unless a Co-chair resigns from their position, terms should be staggered between the two Co-chairs. A graduate student may not serve more than one term as a Co-chair.

# Estimated Time Commitment
CS Women Co-chairs can be a significant time commitment. Other departmental service is highly discouraged during Co-chair tenure. Expect to spend 5-10/hrs per week on CS Women responsibilities. Expect to spend fewer hours when non-essential positions are filled.

# Additional Eligibility Notes and Requirements
Graduate Co-chairs must be enrolled in a graduate degree program in CICS, be in good academic standing, have attended at least three (3) CS Women sponsored events, and must have either (a) held an assistantship for two semesters or (b) have completed 12 course credits applied to the graduate degree.
