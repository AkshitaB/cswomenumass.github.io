# WW2A Mentorship Program
The first days of a graduate program can be both exciting and challenging. Successful students often cite having a diverse support group of friends and family.
This fall, CSWomen will launch a mentorship program for incoming students, where we will pair domestic and international students with a current graduate student as a mentor. 
Following are the list of volunteering mentors:

Egid, Adin <br>
Roy Chowdhury, Aruni <br>
Freire, Cibele <br>
Sankaranarayanan, Sandhya <br>
Moscovici, Eva <br>
Galhotra, Sainyam <br>
Raman, Gowtham <br>
Jung, Hee-Tae <br>
Lalor, John <br>
Lingeman, Jesse <br>
De, Nabanita <br>
