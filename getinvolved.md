Are you interested in...

 - Helping us attract and retain more female students and faculty in CS?
 - Finding a mentor or a mentee? 
 - Getting involved in k-12 outreach opportunities? 
 - Socializing with other women in computing? 
 - Brainstorming on how we could better serve the UMass community? 

All of these and more are great reasons to get involved with CS Women! 

The best way to get started is to join us on [Slack](http://cswomen.slack.com) using your UMass email address, but of course you can always email us directly at: womenchairs@cs.umass.edu.
